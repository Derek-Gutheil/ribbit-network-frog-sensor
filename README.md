[This project will create the world's largest Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset that will empower anyone to join in the work on climate and provide informed data for climate action.](https://ribbitnetwork.org/)

Ribbit Network is a large network of open-source, low-cost, Greenhouse Gas (CO2 and hopefully other gasses in the future) Detection Sensors. These sensor units will be sold by the Ribbit Network and will upload their data to the cloud, creating the world's most complete Greenhouse Gas dataset.

[See more about the cloud database here.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-dashboard)

## Frog Sensors
Our “Frogs” are tiny sensors that you can buy and deploy at your own home! It’s a small, open-source box that measures the amount of CO2 in the air using a tiny laser.
It's easy to set up and will constantly record valuable scientific data on our climate.
Frogs are one of the species that are most affected by climate change! Just like our sensors, they ribbit to one another to create a powerful network of data about the environment.

## Current Status
[The design of sensor version 1](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/milestone/1) has just been completed and is ready for deployment. The first few units are being produced now and sent to a long list of waiting Alpha testers. The instructions are also complete for building a sensor (see below).

The first prototype sensors are up and running! [Here is some real data from our sensor network!](https://ribbit-network.herokuapp.com/) (Note this dashboard is still experimental and may be down occasionally).

There is still a ton of interesting work to do however!

Check out our issues for ongoing work! In the near future we have several major goals:
* [Reduce the cost of the sensor](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/projects/6) This requires more custom engineering.
* [Create a solar power version of the sensor](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/projects/2) (this requires reducing the power consumption and designing the solar circuitry)
* [Improve the sustainability](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-sensor/projects/7) We strive to ensure that the Frog is the most sustainable version of the sensor that we can reasonably produce.
