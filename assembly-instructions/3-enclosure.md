# Enclosure Assembly

The main body of the enclosure is called a [Stevenson screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevenson_screen) and should arrive like this.

The sensor will function fine with the enclosure as is, but most people choose to add the cute frog head features and some paint to improve the aesthetics of the enclosure. If you aren't planning to do that, you can skip this step and head to the [Electronics Section.](4-electronics.md)

## Attaching the Head

Firstly, we need to attach the main body of the head to the rest of the enclosure.

To do this, we need to remove the top layer of the Stevenson screen. This is done by removing 4 screws on the inside of the enclosure.

Once that's done, you can attach the head to the top of the enclosure using the 4 screws removed in the last step and the four screw holes in the 3D printed frog head. 

**Note:** You may have to use a small screw driver to widen the holes a bit depending on the quality of your 3D print.

## Painting the Enclosure
This is the time to paint the Frog Head. We do this before we attach the eyes and mouth so that we don't change their color :smile:.

The [Krylon Outdoor DÃ©cor Spray Paint, Shamrock](https://www.amazon.com/Krylon-Outdoor-Decor-Paint-Shamrock/dp/B072RPLT81) results in a nice color.

## Attach the Mouth & Eyes
The eyes and mouth are attached using the two part epoxy from the [Bill of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lsWCXFawsJNGc44bqFXWkpjHfIFZQEj5UceJV4AiuK0/edit#gid=0). Follow the instructions and apply just a little bit of epoxy into the cutouts for the mouth and eyes.

## Done!
Now the cute enclosure is done!
