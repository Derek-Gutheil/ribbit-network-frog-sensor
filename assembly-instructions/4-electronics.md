# Electronics

Now to assemble the electronics. The first step is to attach all of the electronics to the 3D printed bracket.

To do this, attach the brass standoffs to the bracket which we will attach the electronics to. This is easiest to do with a 4.5 hex socket. Be careful not to over tighten the standoff in the bracket!
