The cost of "true" (measured P.P.M.) CO2 sensors are now low. This enables a large grassroots greenhouse gas monitoring network to inspire climate awareness and action while generating a large scientific data set.

There is a precedent for GHG networks in academia:

- http://beacon.berkeley.edu/overview/. The BEACO2N Project uses extremely expensive sensors, making cost a significant barrier to deployment at scale.
- MUCCnet - Research done in Munich showed that incredible insights can be gained from sensor networks like this one in identifying the source of emissions: "Chen explains the principle in simple terms: "We set up one sensor upwind from the city and the second downwind. So any increase in gases between the first sensor and the second must have been generated from inside the city." To cover as many wind directions as possible, there is a sensor in each cardinal direction. With the input of the sensor data and meteorological parameters, high-performance computers can create a spatially resolved emission map of the city."
